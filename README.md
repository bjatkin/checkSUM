# checkSUM
This is an HCI artifact which was created for CS 656 Interactive Software Systems

# Building the project
Now that we are using webpack, we can auto-generate the bundle.js file.
Simply run `npm run build` in the checkSUM directory in order to recomplie the main.js file.

# Viewing the project
To view the project you can start a locahost server in the checkSUM/public directory.
This will serve the index.html file.
